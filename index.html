        </h1>


        <p>
            <b>Vikram Sarabhai </b>, son of Ambalal Sarabhai, he came from the famous Sarabhai family from India who
            were
            major industrialists
            committed to the Indian independence movement. Vikram Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini in
            1942. The couple had two children. His daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist,
            and his son Kartikeya too became an active person in science. During his lifetime, he practiced
            Jainism. He attended Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the University of Cambridge,
            England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge to
            pursue PhD and wrote a thesis, “Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes,” in 1947.
